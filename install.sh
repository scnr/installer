Codename SCNR Terms & Conditions of Supply

IMPORTANT NOTICE: PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS BEFORE ORDERING OR DOWNLOADING ANY SOFTWARE FROM THIS WEBSITE AS APPLICABLE TO THE LICENCE AND USE OF THAT SOFTWARE.

These Codename SCNR Terms & Conditions of Supply together with the documents referred to in it ("Terms") constitute the terms and conditions on which Ecsypno Single Member P.C. ("Licensor") will grant to any purchaser or user ("Licensee") a licence to use the software comprising Codename SCNR ("Codename SCNR" or the "Software"), following acceptance of an order as detailed below.

The following expressly form part of the Terms:

- The Codename SCNR License Agreement;

- The General Terms and Conditions;

- The Privacy Policy; and

- Any other documents referred to in the above.

The Terms apply to the exclusion of any other terms that the Licensee seeks to impose or incorporate, or which are implied by trade, custom, practice or course of dealing.

1. Licenses to Codename SCNR are available for purchase via the Licensor's website at https://ecsypno.com/products/scnr.

2. Placing an order for Codename SCNR or checking "I have read and accept the terms and conditions" on a webform is an offer by the Licensee to purchase a licence to the Software and does not constitute a contract until such time as the Licensor issues an email or web confirmation that the order is accepted by Ecsypno Single Member P.C..  Notwithstanding the foregoing, by installing the Software the Licensee affirms that it agrees to the terms of the License and the Codename SCNR terms and conditions of supply, which bind the Licensee and its employees.  The contract will only relate to the Software the Licensee has licensed, as set out in that confirmation or accepted by installing it.  Notwithstanding any other communications between the parties, ordering and/or downloading the Software by the Licensee, or the download of the Software by another party at the instigation of the Licensee, shall constitute conclusive evidence that the Licensee has purchased the Software on the basis of these Terms & Conditions of Supply and Ecsypno Single Member P.C.'s order quotation.

3. Unless Ecsypno Single Member P.C. has pre-approved the Licensee's purchase on credit in writing (and subject to any additional credit terms that apply to any such approval), payment is required in advance. Shortly after the Licensee makes payment and the order has been accepted by Ecsypno Single Member P.C., the Licensee will receive an email containing instructions enabling the Licensee to log in and download the Licensee's software and licence key.  If the Licensee does not receive this email within 30 minutes of making payment, please email the Licensor, who will investigate the issue and endeavour to respond within one working day. In relation to purchases made on agreed credit terms, Ecsypno reserves the right to charge interest under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 on invoiced amounts unpaid by their due date.

4. If the Licensee's license is subject to auto-renewal and the Licensee has provided a valid recurring payment method, then payment will be taken 14 days before the expiry of the then current License Period (as defined in the Codename SCNR License Agreement) ("Renewal Payment Date"). Auto-renewal for specific licences can be disabled on the Licensee's account page.

5. If the Licensee wishes to cancel its order, please email the Licensor, within 7 days of making payment or payment being taken for auto-renewal licenses, or if the order has been placed on credit, credit having been pre-approved by Ecsypno Single Member P.C., please email the Licensor within 7 days of placing the order, and in each case before the Licensee downloads the software or licence key.  If the Licensee already downloaded the software or licence key, it will not be possible to refund the order.

6. If the Licensee's payment is subject to any tax liability within any jurisdiction (for example, withholding tax) then it bears sole responsibility for meeting this liability, and no deductions must be made in the amount paid to Ecsypno Single Member P.C..  Ecsypno Single Member P.C. does not accept liability for any tax liabilities that may arise from the Licensee's purchase of the Software or any associated services hereunder.

7. When the contract for the purchase of Codename SCNR has been concluded, such contract is made for the benefit of the Licensee and Ecsypno Single Member P.C. only and is not intended to benefit, or be enforceable by, anyone else.

8. These Terms (including all the documents referred to in them) are governed by and construed in accordance with Greek Law and submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Greek courts.

1.2. If the License is subject to auto-renewal, a new License Period will commence on the expiry of the previous License Period, subject to successful payment being taken on the Renewal Payment Date.

1.4.6.2. the Licensee has purchased the Software directly from the Licensor.

1.5. If the Licensee is a purchaser who has lawfully obtained the Software other than by direct purchase from the Licensor, the Licensee may carry out the activities specified in sections 1.4.1 to 1.4.5 above and, in consideration of the Licensor agreeing to provide updates of the Software to the Licensee during the License Period, either directly or via the relevant intermediary or intermediaries, the Licensee agree to be bound by the License directly in favour of the Licensor.

7.3.

The Licensee must not attempt in any way to remove or circumvent any such TPM, nor apply or manufacture for sale or hire, import, distribute, sell or let for hire, offer or expose for sale or hire, advertise for sale or hire or have in its possession for private or commercial purposes any means the sole intended purpose of which is to facilitate the unauthorised removal or circumvention of such TPM.

The above defence and indemnification obligations do not apply if (1) the allegation does not state with specificity that the Software or services are the basis of the Third Party Claim; (2) a Third Party Claim arises from the use or combination of the Software or services or any part thereof with software, hardware, data, or processes not provided by Licensor, if the Software or Services or use thereof would not infringe without such combination; (3) a Third Party Claim arises from Software or services for which there is no charge or has been provided on a free trial or community licence basis; or (4) a Third Party Claim arises from the Licensee's or a third party's materials or application or Licensee's breach of this Agreement.  This clause provides the Licensor's sole liability to, and the Licensee's exclusive remedy against, the Licensor for any Third Party IPR Claim.
